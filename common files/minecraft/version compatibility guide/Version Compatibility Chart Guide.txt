## Version Compatibility Chart Guide

Colors:
Green: Fully works as intended
Yellow: Some features may be unavailable
Orange: Some features may not work/be broken
Red: Many/Core features are not usable/will not launch

Versions:
This chart shows all versions from 1.20 onward that aren't just hotfixes (e.g. 1.21.1).

For example, if a pack says it's compatible with 1.21, that counts 1.21.1, but doesn't necessarily count 1.21.2.
